Name: Morgan Gant

My goal statement is:

I want to gain a basic understanding of what Sofware development in, how software's differ from each other and when to use 
a certain software and be able to compare it to Data Science. 
I learned this summer that as a Data Scientist it's important to know a little about each role on your team so this 
class will help me in the future when teamwork is needed!
